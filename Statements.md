***The Primary Statement***
> Describe the motion of a transverse wave that has wavelength of 2, amplitudes ranging smoothly between -1, +1 expect at -0, +0 where nodes form.

Certainly! Here are the equations for the described motion of a transverse wave:

**Differential Equation**
$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$

**Linear Algebraic Equations**
$Au = \lambda u$

**Algebraic Equation**
$a x^2 + b x + c = 0$

**Statistical Equation**
$P(X = x) = p$

**Wave Equation**
$u(x, t) = A \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}(x - ct)\right)$

**Set Theoretic Equation**
$A \cap B$

**Computational Complexity Equation**
$T(n) = O(f(n))$

**Proof Theoretic Equation**
$\vdash \phi$

**Category Theoretic Equation**
$f \circ g$

**Quantum Mechanical Equation**
$i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V \Psi$

**Music Theory Equation**
$f(t) = A \sin(2\pi f t + \phi)$

**Boolean Algebraic Equation**
$A \cdot B + \overline{A + B} = 1$
