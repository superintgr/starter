[time: feature of the multiverse]
[-1] let unit time be defined in terms of wave period
[-0] total number of all rows is the unit duration where total number of columns represent entangled universes
[+0] each instance of time for each unit momentum variable across all the universes at that cross section represent the same abstract variable for the whole set
[+1] for each abstract variable of which the information variable participating in the column computation unit measurement yields different proportion of the same index attribut


[sampler: relativistic transformation]
[-1] whenever we sample k frames with h frequency and the data constitutes t second of sample time
[-0] for each t second of clock time, the samples constitute k * h worth of measurable quantities
[+0] with a metric space always available, measurement could be made on the state vector
[+1] when input to the forward function is reached, one creats a level set where the unwanted interferences are quiet down to their possible minima
[1-] from the relative minimum, a ground for computation is constructed, on top of which all of the processing is defined for
[0-] the unitary moments between multiple ground states that are mixed in complex matter would violate scaling laws and the differentiated scales produce a unitary vector
[0+] the quickest form of processing is the straight pass through of the input through parametric surface where it instantiated
[1+] a straight through projection on the surface which contains the right information variables would yield the exact proportion to the unit step interval effective across the scaler factor

[schedule: field variable]
[-1] identity, *identity, group, action are all field variables
[-0] identity : input/output, group/action -> group/output, input/action
[+0] action : output/group, action/input -> input/group, action/input
[+1] group : identity/output, input/identity -> action/identity, identity/action

[code: sampler function]
[-1] restore hidden state and compute new field
[-0] measure field variable and sample state vector
[+0] prepare visible state and store old field
[+1] construct group variable and transform state vector
