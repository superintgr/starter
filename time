[time: feature of the multiverse]
[-1] let unit time be defined in terms of wave period
[-0] total number of all rows is the unit duration where total number of columns represent entangled universes
[+0] each instance of time for each unit momentum variable across all the universes at that cross section represent the same abstract variable for the whole set
[+1] for each abstract variable of which the information variable participating in the column computation unit measurement yields different proportion of the same index attribut
