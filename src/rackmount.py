Can audio data be used to record and restore electrical energy to translate into supply current?


Suppose we setup a simulation with the following set of things:
- physical processors and power supply
- electrical networks and transmission lines
- current supply and utility substrates
- central processing modules and interface methods
- energy distribution and utility cost calculation
- programming constructs and executive processes
- data collection and storage environments
- thermodynamic and information statistics
- computation complexity and computable functions


With the simulated environment that has all of its energetic and entropic events and objects that construct physical processes.

(we setup a transmission network with lines distributing powerful services to various object spaces), (we represent each lines of wires that connect two endpoints with a track and associate a channel to it)

(the transmited energy is encoded into wave files that mimic the carrier substrate)

(channel) what is the definition of a channel and what are contributing to the signal image?

- my conceptualization is that a channel physically instantiated into a substrate provides an isolated environment for the signal that some line carries. a line will have some physically handlable endpoints that will hook two objects at their porting authorities and between the two terminals, the physical cable contains the information at all time for which the two endpoints are still a valid description.

lines may introduce reflection and also refraction like feedback from one of the endpoints which will depend on the degrees of freedom that transmission circuit have available.

(channel is a substrate which takes in incoming wave energy, process the waveform while inside the medium, route portion of the signal or send completely to other channels, sum up all intermediate interference, push out the current through outlet functions.

(the issues I have with simulation codes is that they don't participate in any form in the already mixed interface that has an expectation form which these digital outlets completely ignore)

(what is instead required is active acknowledgement of the continuous symmetry in being able to measure any observables from digital interfaces while keeping a discrete approximation scheme that is fully quantum generalizable)

(let the configuration be one that places function approximators in charge of the quantization process and substrate variables that are parameterized for instantiating the analogous part of the computation that is finitely specifiable but infinitely realizable)

(the infinite continum of observables that we cannot either observe or accurate estimate for are not the subject of interest in reality. therefore the spectrum of operating functions must be bidirectionally supported where the sampling procees should be treated as measurable outcomes at which at least two set of attributes from our discrete state space actively depends on)

(there are three other phases besides measurement that must be taken into consideration at all times. they are computation, preparation, other construction -- all together provides the definition of our substrate)

(sampling with a frequency that is widely known to limit how accurately should a selection of oscillating behavior be able to accurately gather all the underlying bandwidth components -- the nyquist frequency for example is the one that says any sampling process must employ a signal of frequency twice the underlying bandwidth in order to accurately capture the instrinsic attributes of the source signal)

(that is inherently typical since there are more than one phase space for s signal that minimally propagate in some medium with one of the phase space attributes, so for each expansion along primary pole direction, there is already an opposite pole which must at some point restore the energetic movement at any point in time but there are plenty more degrees that gets excersided for any non trivial computation on a medium)

(instead of considering the bare minimum capacity or arbitrarily high capacity for channel actions, we determine the unique set of observables and find out what dimensionality must they occupy. then setup instances of channel spaces for each dimensions where the channel parameters are assumed to express all of the local degrees of freedom for the signal passing through it. now it should be noted that the driving state construction must also originate with the same characteristic profile or set of discrete spectrums)

(when the mixing system has k isolated channels any signal coming through it must be seen as identity operations on that specified relative state. the pooling of all physically instantiated processing graphs flowing into a medium with higher index of refraction is the master-slave network where we take the output of the master graph to be local accssible information while all slave substrates instantiate locally inaccessible information in regards to the observables of our system.)
