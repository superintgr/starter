completely non-polar: electronegetivities are identical and difference is zero.
completely polar: electronegetivity differences are large enough and atoms take one of the electrons to make complete polar situation.

Bond polarity is typically divided into three groups that are loosely based on the difference in electronegativity between the two bonded atoms.
According to the Pauling scale:
- Nonpolar bonds generally occur when the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is less than 0.5
- Polar bonds generally occur when the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is roughly between 0.5 and 2.0
- Ionic bonds generally occur when the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is greater than 2.0

quantum-mechanical description:
- Pauling proposed that the wave function for a polar molecule AB is a linear combination of wave functions for covalent and ionic molecules: ψ = aψ(A:B) + bψ(A+B−)
- The amount of covalent and ionic character depends on the values of the squared coefficients a2 and b2
