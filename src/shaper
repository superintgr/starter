(+1) shape optimization over memory blocks:
  -1: assign block with ranges of sub blocks within same substrate
  -0: start a thread of type primary with secondary thread as tuple of sub blocks
  +0: statt a thread of type secondary with primary thread as tuple of at least one unique block
  +1: create a process of type main with maximum recursion depth and conditional switching statement
    -1: create a process of type main with maximum recursive depth and conditional switching statement
    +1: start a subprocess of type (1) with minimum recursive depth or maximum switch statements
  -1: start a subprocess of type (0) with minimum recursion depth or maximum switch statements
(-1) start a subprocess of type main with i recursive depth and j consecutive span of block code where switch is not True



tune the neighbors from a immutable 1 parameter family
    where parameter family codes the envelope in parallel
squeeze all mutable permutatables until unity.
