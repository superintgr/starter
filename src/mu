[-1] The sensorimotor mu rhythm, [-0] also known as mu wave, comb or wicket rhythms or arciform rhythms, are synchronized patterns [+0] of electrical activity[+1] involving large numbers of neurons[-1], probably of the pyramidal type[-0], in the part of the brain [+0] that controls voluntary movement.[+0] 

[+1] These patterns as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or electrocorticography (ECoG), [-1] repeat at a frequency of 7.5–12.5 (and primarily 9–11) Hz, [-0] and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest.[+0]

Unlike the alpha wave[+1] , which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting visual cortex [-1] at the back of the scalp [-0], the mu rhythm is found over the motor cortex[+0], in a band approximately from ear to ear [+1].

[-1] People suppress mu rhythms [-0] when they perform motor actions [+0] or, with practice [+1], when they visualize performing motor actions [-1].

[-0] This suppression is called desynchronization[+0] of the wave[+1] [-1] because EEG wave forms are caused[-0] by large numbers of neurons firing [+0] in synchrony[+1].

[-1] The mu rhythm is even suppressed when one observes[-0] another person [+0] performing a motor action [+1] or an abstract motion with biological characteristi [-1].

[-0] Researchers such as V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues have suggested that this is a sign that the mirror neuron system is involved in mu rhythm suppression,[+0] although others disagree.[+1]
