virtual reality
past environments
rendering
repetoire of past destinations
adjustable clocks of any system
counterfactual conditional
time travel
travel into the future
while I am not travelling today, the active worker of pending constructions
move straight through time into the future and see if I had it or not
if arbitrary number of travellers could travel and shall not come back, the worst case is that the workers did go where they had no target deadline
task being that which always keeps me never bothered by todo lists
