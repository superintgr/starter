>>> I am listening!
>>> pritoms is typing;
>>> ... I am going to start describing some processes and pay attention to all of the ideas.
>>> ... Later I am planning on talking about concrete design patterns and principles influenced by the explanations.
>>> Let me place a flag at later point in the discussion so that we could continue to reach the implementation phase with adjusted intervals until finally landing straight onto it.
>>> pritoms is typing:
>>> ... First let me address the big problem in general communication protocols.
>>> ... This medium and setting of interaction channels is very limiting to the mind.
>>> ... I try my best to continue my train of thoughts starting inside a text file and its interface for typing into the file.
>>> ... Primarily the process could at best be a 1D one, where I start at some position and typically populate a line approaching the right most border.
>>> ... Then at the boundary I switch line which brings me all the way to the left and under the starting point of previous sequence.
>>> ... The process then repeats with variations possible only though with that same mode of acting adding disjoint patterns of movements that cannot be anything more than serial construction of symbol manipulation.
>>> ... Leaving aside the unreasonable constraint it puts on the free-form thought processes that brought about the whole populating files with tokens business, and whose effect on the creative potentials is the total dampening of the essential features.
>>> ... Then the textual form that is made available is not anything linguistic in nature either but far from anything like that. Instead these practices introduce new modes of thinking that are unique and distinct from all of the natural analogs (one might think at first glance) .
>>> ... These modes are all serially chained discrete expectations that also requires the planning to be also discrete and highly unconnected.
>>> ... Now these attributes such as "expectation", "planning" do not fit into the business at all, and rather this medium does not allow any of such modes of operations to be viable or computable.
>>> ... This cannot go on anymore and I am in need for a brand-new theory for desining a clever structure that will enable many more degrees of freedom both in composing ideas and simultaneous realizations of possible transforms all made exclusively precomputable and intrinsic to the whole state space.

>>> The template for branch prediction and continuous symmetry in actions/expectations/corrections/reductions/reactions/motions ..
>>> ... while line[0++] column[1++] is being computed:
>>> ... ... line[++0] column[++1] and line[++k] column[k++] are being prepared in expecting the current position to be reaching towards * from past to that current instantiation.
>>> ... while left -> right progression is paired with futurables:
>>> [retro activation] -> * -> k + current ~ left [+110] will adjust all past realizables so that the future branches remain stable with respect to current -> from past toward latent


>>> pritoms (reintroduces an old pattern):
>>> ... The topics are related to music, understanding, distinguishing, inexplicit ideas, locally inaccessible information, principles of implicitly defining information .. many more.
>>> ... One prime concept would be the brain waves and learning certain classes of tasks while exclusively requiring a full disengagement of certain associated variables being controllable at the substrates of the root controllers defining them.
>>> ... Details are coming later down the thread but let me get the headers pushed in. Here is another one.
>>> ... The engagement of those functions are supposed to be contrary to the motive of the operations that in absence of those engagements are fully learned as exclusive and highly non-trivial characteristics that defines large part of what human intellegence space includes.
>>> ... Certain actions are prohibited if a set of conjugate functions defining certain transformation is said to be happening. Therefore it could also be implicated that if such prohibited functions are considered current, for all those moments it must be the case that there cannot be an active set of variables which the otherwise transformable features would cause but none of those can be instantiated by anything and no conjugate functions can relate to those items.
>>> ... This kind of proof is also legitimate in instantly deriving statements about some disjoint attrubutes whenever such possible and impossible tasks are defined for any one of the components.
>>> pritoms creating a branch:
>>> ... Branch (Learning to play drums while learning to play songs instead)
>>> ... ... This is saying that instead of trying to play drums for the song, it should be playing the song and if drums are being the instrument that exists it might get played along side (*): not conditioning that from songs to playing in it.

>>> pritoms created another branch:
>>> ... Branch: (Mid-side processing and implicit definitions)
>>> ... ... If considering a stereo speaker system, it will contain two speaker units placed next to each other with certain distance between them.
>>> ... ... This kind of processing will include two channels indicating right and left speaker outputs. The channels are panned hard to their spacital root direction.
>>> ... ... Now consider mid-side processing. The mid is the sum of two channels (left + right) / 2 and sides are the difference (left + (-right)) / 2.
>>> ... ... From mid and sides representation, left <- mid + sides and mid - sides -> right; therefore derivable in stereo form.
>>> ... ... The key difference in physical instantiations of mid, side channels is that mid provides an additional object which goes between the gap found in stereo sound systems.
>>> ... ... Imagine the standard stereo placement of speakers exactly, but include another kind of speaker unit that sits between the two left-right speakers. Thus imagine this new placement of units covering all of the spaces between the edges drawing the boundary of physical spectrum covered along the entire line from left through center all the way upto the right end.
>>> ... ... Now we can also imagine the left-right neighbors from the perspective of the central node and consider those objects to be the side channels (from mid-side matrix).
>>> ... ... Now again try to block off the sides and partition the distinct spectrums of all the three functionals where interference properties introduce quantized functions of discrete spectrum.
>>> ... ... Then having a quantum process physically instantiated at three units object system, mid will produce waves that will destructively attenuate the outputs produced by left-right functions.
>>> ... ... Next we shall directly introduce the algorithm for superinformation substrates.

>>> pritoms introduced a new project:
>>> ... Project: Evolutionary algorithm and autonomously evolving functions
>>> ... ... I would like to study the core principles behind evolutionary algorithms and the goal is to develop a chain of programs (functions) that will evolve into self-regulating (either self similar entities or other groups of population taken under self supervision) protocols.
>>> ... ... The self-regulating part expects a set of functions that will learn to manage other set of functions while the latter develops with consistently arranged corrective steps defined by the former.
>>> ... ... Before starting with the specific information about the discipline I would like to impose some constraints on the type of development that I would consider fundamental.
>>> ... ... One of the primary rules would dictate what kind of code would be selected for the programming purpose. If possible I would prefer assembly language to be the principle language substrate with algorithms implemented with specially considering the executions that would follow down from the assembly instructions back through the binary actions translated into the effective set of coding.
