[computational gate]
.. a system that is described an algorithm which performs a fixed set of operations in fixed duration of time
.. also called logic gate

[quantum gate]
.. is a physical process
.. whose laws of motion implements a rule
.. that defines each output qubit
.. in terms of the input qubits.

[transformer]
.. coils, windings, sides
.. transport electrons through field operators
.. number of winding determines the transport ratio
.. balancing, impedence matching, screening ground loops etc. among the utilities

[circuit]
.. define algorithm in terms of qubits, channels, runtime, sequencers, gates, states etc.
.. for each node in the sequences, define compute, measure
.. for each antinode in the bars, define preperation, construction (other)

[coherent]
.. observables at one time is observables for that system at other times
.. time dependent hamiltonian
.. [coherence]
  .. a process is [coherent] if observables at the end of the process are functions only of the observables of the same system at the beginning
  .. inteference phenomena and all quantum computation occur only at in [coherent] systems.

[background]
.. here we setup and configure the first parallel subsystem
.. the subsystem will run in a dedicated server and would be accessible at specific addresses
.. there will be pipeline(s) which the thread will continue indefinitely
.. [pipeline]
  .. stay available for discovery and listen to any changes
  .. [sampler], [buffer], [distribution], [
  .. carry out requested job, stage the recurrent proxesses into active buffer, respond to buffer lookups





[sounddevice]
import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np
import os

.. sound device has two types of operations
.. .. (1) collecting input stream from the source channels of the device
.. .. (2) playing output stream from the source arrays of the memory

.. we have to select the device and configure the following/
.. .. (input, output) channels
.. .. (sample rate)
.. .. (datatype)

[cli]
.. there are preset programs for io tasks available
.. we can call the script with relevant arguments to execute the functionalities
.. for recording we can specify the output path and memory map the file to the processing node



[continuity]
.. any set of informal statements that could not be computed by my particular system
.. either there are definite network architectures that contains all possible elements
.. or the partial encoding of possible variables that could have one of the other variables
.. any realization that leads to an isolated system is decoherent or rationally coherent.


[streaming from url]
.. sounddevice will stream audio in real time from an url
.. it gathers the stream information from the url
.. it checks that only one stream is available of type audio
.. the gathered information contain channel counts, sampling rate etc.
.. sounddevice opens the output of the stream through ffmpeg and instantiates a raw output stream object (RawOutputStream)
.. before starting playback, it collects a certain number of frames as queued items
.. the offset stored in the buffer eliminates race conditions
.. sounddevice employs the callback function which receives each discarded items from the queue and puts it into the playback queue
.. stream from queue continuously runs in the background for collecting new observables and pushes them into the queue
.. a continously running loop breaks whenever there is a forced termination

[local streamable url]
.. select a directory for publishing playlist
.. 




[systematisize]
.. we acquired memory as volume of controlled region of space
.. for causing any change to that space, there have to agreements that raises/lowers any changable parameters
.. whenever there is a dynamical movements, there is a corresponding commutator that moves at least one other elements
.. for minimum workflow to be viable at all time along any of the observed coordinates, there would have to be a non-zero gradient somewhere
.. a non-zero gradient would correspond to proportional balancing to be activated somewhere within the network
.. therefore for any viable operations to be possible, the equillibrium among the global configuration space must not happen all at once

[ordered sequences]
.. start with the basic computation and measurement which would put any commuting variables to the place where error correction would be realized
.. once the basis states are achieved, the next elementary step would make preparation and (other) construction to be eligible
.. with all of the physical parameters and associated operators in participation, the general motion of logical parameters with associated variables must not superceade the physical observable criterion
.. if stuck at some local minima/maxima where regular networks of constructors are not being made possible over last consequetive span of times, it may still be possible that a new observer and/or substrate (joint) become eligible for attachment
.. when sufficient basis is possible to compose via additional set of transformations, any locally impossible statement may become jointly possible via connecting each isolated localities through common base parameters




[gemini]
.. api and authentication
.. cost and administration
.. generators, processors, loader, displayer



[callback]
.. at each change in the device state
.. a callback can be assigned to the processing function
.. callback is responsible for handling the observable parameters of the target system
.. for any decoherence caused in the observer system would reflect simultaneously across the energy eigen elements


[schrodingers picture]
.. (-unitary)[t] * (density) * [t](unitary).T
.. produces density[t]
.. change happens in the density structure with respect to time parameters
  .. -i[commutation[t], density[t]]

[eigenvectors for density]
.. ket is a column vector
.. denotes vector information
.. n'th eigenvector of the density matrix at time t
.. |n; t> labeled by n amd t

.. row vector ket(alpha)
.. <alpha| is the hermitian.T vector
.. dual vector of the ket alpha


[scalar product]
.. <beta|alpha>

[squared norm]
.. squared norm of |alpha>
.. <alpha|alpha>

[hilbert space]
.. scalar norm of kets
.. hilbert space
.. vector space with norm




[other construction]
.. other construction tasks surrounding the information processing
.. [measurement], [preparation]
  .. measurement takes a physical system as input
  .. measurement process yields information about the system
.. preparation produces the desired description of a system
.. preparation expects some physical system whose states have implicit criteria for which any possible description would satisfy the required basis.

.. the incoming edge onto the preparation step, implies a new construction formulation where the outlet would conform to the principles asserted.
.. principles assert the kind of dynamics that passively requires any transformation to obey its own law of motion and whereby it would make the knowledge about the asserted attributes realizable through physical means.


[information]
.. we define any substrate that is capable of varying at least of its state components such that the other possible components would comprise of an equivalent set of states where the inverse process would transform that formulation to all possible charateristic transform criteria
.. then a substrate maching the permutability criteria would make information processing possible using the states of the substrate
.. an information processing media is thus an object satisfying the description like such would constitute a basis for formulating the specific type.

.. performing a permutation operation over all of the states of the substrate
.. would have to satify the following:
  .. a reversible computation on the set produces a new set

  .. the new set has all the elements of the old set with their polarity reversed with respect to each of the polar angles.

.. when we define the permutation operator, it must be linear
.. if it must be linear then any element that it could act on follows the pattern where the action is described by what could have been if action was applied to one of the other observables from that state.
