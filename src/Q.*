[computational gate]
.. a system that is described an algorithm which performs a fixed set of operations in fixed duration of time
.. also called logic gate

[quantum gate]
.. is a physical process
.. whose laws of motion implements a rule
.. that defines each output qubit
.. in terms of the input qubits.

[transformer]
.. coils, windings, sides
.. transport electrons through field operators
.. number of winding determines the transport ratio
.. balancing, impedence matching, screening ground loops etc. among the utilities

[circuit]
.. define algorithm in terms of qubits, channels, runtime, sequencers, gates, states etc.
.. for each node in the sequences, define compute, measure
.. for each antinode in the bars, define preperation, construction (other)

[coherent]
.. observables at one time is observables for that system at other times
.. time dependent hamiltonian
.. [coherence]
  .. a process is [coherent] if observables at the end of the process are functions only of the observables of the same system at the beginning
  .. inteference phenomena and all quantum computation occur only at in [coherent] systems.

[background]
.. here we setup and configure the first parallel subsystem
.. the subsystem will run in a dedicated server and would be accessible at specific addresses
.. there will be pipeline(s) which the thread will continue indefinitely
.. [pipeline]
  .. stay available for discovery and listen to any changes
  .. [sampler], [buffer], [distribution], [
  .. carry out requested job, stage the recurrent proxesses into active buffer, respond to buffer lookups
