- start with a state pair (logical, mechanical)
- logical state encodes the current path of the cpu processor
- mechanical state encodes the current path of the dac processor
- set a runtime period in clock cycles and assign execution calls to intervals
- define the arm configuration with interval maps and store the callbacks
- start the main block with callback and memory addresses
- when main is executed, the block will call the callable with local clock time and return addresses
- return addresses are dictionary keys that is locally managed
- when the callback is processed, it returns the pid for a seperate process
- pid will be observed for status periodically or waited in sleep cycles until the maximal duration is reached
- pid sends all samples to the dictionary maps as values
- when finished the pid will have to be released by the main thread
- before releasing, the dictionary is transferred onto the memorty addresses
- before halting, the local heaps are all cleared.
