sys report and record creation : current device
os report and record update : current clock

unit : unitary motion of objects
object : contained inside system -> behavior from addressing
behavior : from static definitions, with changes proportional to clock -> system @ view <- static object not changing
unchanging : from inverted image from program, the system sees changes per unit time in program positions ~ changes being effective based on unchanging memory



last state, expectation value = get unitary operator for system that is current at (t)

new state, reference = send signal sampled from analog substrate with reference to the memory blocks

measurement, preparation = computing the labeled index of evolution for memory elements, and new memory elements for next batch

[see program @ runtime.py]
