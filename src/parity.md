Odd[edit]
Classical variables whose signs flip when inverted in space inversion are predominantly vectors. They include:

h
{\displaystyle h}, helicity
Φ
{\displaystyle \Phi }, magnetic flux
x
{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }, the position of a particle in three-space
v
{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }, the velocity of a particle
a
{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }, the acceleration of the particle
p
{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} }, the linear momentum of a particle
ρ
v
{\displaystyle \rho \,\mathbf {v} }, mass flow[a]
F
{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} }, the force exerted on a particle
J
{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} }, electric current density
E
{\displaystyle \mathbf {E} }, the electric field
D
{\displaystyle \mathbf {D} }, the electric displacement field
P
{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} }, electric polarization
A
{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }, electromagnetic vector potential
S
{\displaystyle \mathbf {S} }, the Poynting vector (flow of electromagnetic power).

Classical variables, predominantly scalar quantities, which do not change upon spatial inversion include:

t
{\displaystyle t}, the time when an event occurs
m
{\displaystyle m}, the mass of a particle
E
{\displaystyle E}, the energy of a particle
P
{\displaystyle P}, power (rate of work done)
ρ
{\displaystyle \rho }, electric charge density
V
{\displaystyle V}, scalar electric potential (voltage)
ρ
{\displaystyle \rho }, energy density of the electromagnetic field
L
{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }, the angular momentum of a particle (both orbital and spin) (axial vector)
B
{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} }, the magnetic field (axial vector)
H
{\displaystyle \mathbf {H} }, the auxiliary magnetic field
M
{\displaystyle \mathbf {M} }, magnetization
T
