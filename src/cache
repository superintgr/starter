>>> … Comment: I will talk about spontaneous unstructured thoughts about neural networks, gradient descent algorithm, landscape re interpretation, spherical geometry and localization theory, qubits etc.
>>> … … Why is it a drunk person finding paths through hntidy steps in the space of searching stochastic parameters that also seem to drive eventually to the relative minima?
>>> … …

>> events attended? god is recording you in phonons
>> beats; for both detecting and driving the detectors that drove you away
>> designing the test that really measures the impossibility of cloning or adapt anyhow but not precisely — use the substrate in brain probably governed by mu waves that keeps the parts involved in motor development away from certain processes (LOOK UP THE EXACT DESCRIPTION IN WIKI, it has to do with autistic people failing to recognize certain attributable characteristics in environment due to the inherent blocking of the specific region in the spectrum which makes them vulnerable statically) whereby making any kind of distinction of abstract physical processes that is observed to have caused by another person, through remains in same locality but cannot be understood due to active interference of bilaterally generated mu wave in hemispheric regions that causes destructive changes in neurons trying to synchronize the required oscillatory patterns.
>> impulse control and linearized systematic conjugation; imagine an agent trying to achieve certain objectives and often fails to instantiate the internal structure that would cause the action to occur and also make the destructive interference caused by certain impulse response as function of voluntary engagement to inhibit with respect to the desired state. The agent then learns to translate more of the impulse functions to implicitly support the linear system of band-limited frequencies that jointly employs the right forms of communication.
>>> pritoms started a new discussion
>>> … Name: Agency and state space officials; Spheres and Hemispheric Communications.
>>> … … Imagine a sphere like our earth and some locality such as my living room. Create a spherical object large enough to support many such spaces like my room here.
>>> … … In my room, a brain is present and we shall also represent the brain using a hemisphere object which will be placed inside the volume contained by larger sphere.
>>> … … Assign the hemispheric object some coordinate location where the hemisphere that cuts at the middle two different subspaces where the neural networks will have intrinsic attributes related to the sides they have. The entire substrate that contains the hemispheric partitions will have all of the neural connections including the middle section where the split is defined perceived as being the dead center of symmetry in left-right directions.
>>> … … When the middle is in consideration, the left-right portions will constitute the sides of the mid which will provide centrality with respect to their constituents.
>>> … … Note: The discussion resumes later.

>>> pritoms started a discussion branching from Wikipedia
>>> … … Article: Digital antenna array.
>>> … … I want to start commenting about the history of the analysis and formulation of such methods from the perspective of my own thesis. I didn’t quite like the word “beam-forming” and hence always ignored most things surrounding the details of the task being performed, or the inspirations behind the techniques that solved a set of problems in signal processing in general.
>>> … … The pioneers seemed to have got their interests in the matter from the formulation of multichannel analysis, exclusively dealing with antenna based mediums back then. The focus was to use electronic computers and analog circuits along with algebraic programming of the information processes with the systems connected to antenna networks or radar devices, in order to solve real-time directional finding problems using the high-speed computers digital communication substrates.
>>> … … Before the DAA, people managed the sensor-computer interfaces with input data being provided with cards. Soon this translated into direct injection of input data in the solver programs, thus eliminating the preparation step which required non trivial efforts.
>>> … … superRayleigh resolution of the emission source was a problem that was ultimately solved from these research concerns.
>>> … … Now I discuss the digital beam forming business.
>>> … … The keyword here is “digital”, where analog to digital converters return outputs to beamformers for the receivers channels, and digital to analog conversion from processor signal state in transmitters function.
>>> … … In parallel the digital values could be transformed into whatever is necessary to satisfy the output requirements of the signal states. Signals coming from multiple directions can be estimated simultaneously and integrated for a longer time to increase of signals energy when detection far-off objects and simultaneously integrated for a shorter time to detecting fast-moving close objects.
>>> … … Heterodyne oscillators are usually employed for testing the source characteristics of the signal before sending into the digital beamformers, causing corrective translations in analog setting. Such correction could be used both receiver-transmitter pairs providing active supporting substrate.
>>> … … Ending this thread here, next I will discuss specific relations to my work and the new Hadamard matrices that I have created an interest for recently.
