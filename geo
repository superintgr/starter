geo: meter -> metry
meter:= functional(metry) * functional(geo).inverse()





[geometry] : [meter] is the space where gradient descent algorithm even makes any viable contribution
. the metric space is then the image of the descendent
. the descension from the picture that raises one other image is another picture
. one other image whose dependent attributes anticommute with the reflecting variable whose lowering operation keeps any of the picture possible
. such attribute is dependent on the close commutation relation between (image, another), (one, other) possible combines all attributes for construction
. for the constructors of the closed surface there is the construction whose repetoire includes all possible pictures
. any construction process that creates a viable descendent whose commutation keeps the local repetoire possible, makes the picture possible
. any picture that keeps the possibility of constructing any other picture keeps all possible images to be constructed
. any constructor whose repetoire contains the set of all possible images that keeps at least one of the descendent whose image reflects the surface
. any descent whose operator could cause the descendents to know which image constructs the picture of the surface which contains the image of all descendents
. all such picture must make any such operator non-viable or any such operator must make all such images impossible
. all such descent must keep all such descendent variable and all such variable must cause all such picture to be possible
. any such algorithm must make all such picture intractable or any such computation must keep all such memory reversible
